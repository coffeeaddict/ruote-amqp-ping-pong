Logging
=======

One of the biggest issues with writing daemons are getting insight into what your
daemons are doing. Logging with daemon-kit is simplified as DaemonKit creates log
files per environment in log.

On all environments except production the log level is set to DEBUG, but you can
toggle the log level by sending the running daemon SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.
SIGUSR1 will toggle between DEBUG and INFO levels, SIGUSR2 will blatantly set the
level to DEBUG.

Bundler
=======

daemon-kit uses bundler to ease the nightmare of dependency loading in Ruby 
projects. daemon-kit and its generators all create/update the Gemfile in the
root of the daemon. You can satisfy the project's dependencies by running
`bundle install` from within the project root.
